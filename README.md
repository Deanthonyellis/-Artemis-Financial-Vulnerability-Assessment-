# Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment
# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial aims to enhance the security of their existing application by integrating additional security measures.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I found satisfaction in conducting static testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in my code. Emphasizing secure coding is crucial not just for safeguarding your assets but also for protecting the belongings of your users. The loss of personal information and trade secrets can inflict significant damage on both individuals and enterprises. Developing secure software not only safeguards information but also plays a vital role in preserving a company's reputation over time.What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
By conducting tests, it was determined that a majority of vulnerabilities stemmed from the utilization of outdated libraries. Enhancing the security of the software involves updating the current libraries incorporated into the code. Employing penetration testing in subsequent assessments will provide a more thorough evaluation of potential vulnerabilities within the code.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
While coding the software, I consistently executed debugging processes to verify its functionality. Following the code refactoring, I conducted another vulnerability test to assess the potential introduction of any new vulnerabilities.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
During the software development, I consistently ran debugs to ensure its functionality. After refactoring the code, I performed another vulnerability test to check for any newly introduced vulnerabilities. Additionally, I employed a hash function to enhance security and facilitate encrypted communications.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I utilized a hash function to transmit securely encrypted communications
